# Bloglist Application üìù

This is a full-stack blog application developed as part of the **Full Stack Open** course, specifically focusing on Part 7. The project extends the bloglist application from earlier parts of the course by adding features like routing, user views, and advanced state management.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to the application to manage their own blogs.
* **Blog Management:** Authenticated users can create, view, like, and delete their own blog posts.
* **Comments:** Users can add comments to blog posts.
* **User Views:**
    * A main view that lists all blog posts.
    * A separate view for all registered users, showing the number of blogs they have created.
    * Individual user pages that list all the blogs created by that specific user.
* **Routing:** The application uses **React Router** to provide smooth navigation between different views.
* **State Management:** The application's state is managed using **Redux** or **React Query** and Context, ensuring a clean and scalable architecture.
* **Styling:** The front end is styled with a modern UI framework like **React Bootstrap** or **Material-UI**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SIVAKUMAR1267/Blogapp.git](https://github.com/SIVAKUMAR1267/Blogapp.git)
    cd Blogapp
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the environment variables for the backend:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
    SECRET=<A strong, random secret key for JWT>
    ```

4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

6.  **Start the frontend application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).
